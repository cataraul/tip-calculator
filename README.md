While doing this project i was able to learn more about Css Flexbox, Grid, more about responsive design and a little bit of JavaScript eventListeners, changing styles with javascript.

### Continued development

I am continuously learning about WebDevelopment(more specifically about HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT) everyday. I want to know the fundamentals so good that i wont have to google again. xD

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement#transition_events - This helped me for adding the borders to the svg when the user focuses the input right next to them.
